There is more interest in this project than I originally suspected. I would love to hear about your use cases and suggestions for this project. Please email your thoughts to teynon1@gmail.com.

# ZPL-Label-Designer
Javascript / Web Based designer for ZPL printers.

This is the start of a Javascript based designer for creating ZPL labels.

# Project Status
I no longer work (currently) with ZPL printers. At this time, this project has no real benefit to me. The code base is a bit old now. However, I will consider adding features if there is enough interest. Contributions are welcome as well.
